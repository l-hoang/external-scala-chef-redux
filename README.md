# Scala-Chef-Redux

Scala-Chef-Redux as an external DSL. See 
https://github.com/l-hoang/scala-chef-redux
for original Scala-Chef-Redux.

## Important Notes

* Comments are currently **not optional**.
* The comments must not have any new lines in them (i.e. one paragraph only).
* Method statements **cannot** have more than one new line between them.
* To be safe, put at least 1 blank line (i.e. 2 new lines) between each "section"
of a recipe (e.g. ingredients, methods, titles, etc.).

## Syntax

I am aiming for the syntax to be exactly like the original Chef
spec. This is possible due to not being limited by internal DSL
conventions.
